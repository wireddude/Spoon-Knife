    this is a test, can I sync this back up to the github repo?

    Press enter to submit commands
    > git status
    # On branch master
    # Initial commit
    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
    Success!
    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Initial commit
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #	octocat.txt
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    Success!
    $ git add octocat.txt
    Nice job, you've added octocat.txt to the Staging Area
    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Initial commit
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
    #	new file:   octocat.txt
    Success!
